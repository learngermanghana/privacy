      <h3>Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h3>
      <p>Where the GDPR applies, we rely on <strong>contract</strong>, <strong>legitimate interests</strong> (e.g., security, optimization), and <strong>consent</strong> (e.g., optional cookies/communications where required). You may withdraw consent at any time.</p>
